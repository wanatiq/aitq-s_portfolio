# Crude Birth of Malaysia from 2001 to 2019

## Dashboard Overview
This dashboard provides a comprehensive analysis of the crude birth rate in Malaysia, broken down by year, ethnic group, and sex from 2001 to 2019. It allows users to explore trends and patterns in birth rates, offering insights for policymakers and public health officials to understand the dynamics of population growth in different demographics.

## Problem Statement
The purpose of this dashboard is to visualize and analyze the trends in the crude birth rate across various ethnic groups, genders, and years in Malaysia. By understanding these patterns, stakeholders can make informed decisions regarding healthcare planning, resource allocation, and population policies. The dashboard helps identify declining or increasing trends in birth rates for different ethnic groups, providing a foundation for deeper analysis and intervention strategies.

## Steps followed 

- Step 1 : Data was collected on crude birth rates in Malaysia from 2001 to 2019, categorized by ethnic groups and sex.
- Step 2: The data was cleaned and preprocessed to ensure accuracy and completeness.
- Step 3: Visualization tools and elements, such as line charts, pie charts, and bar charts, were used to represent different aspects of the data.
- Step 4: Filters were added for Year, Ethnic Group, and Sex to allow users to dynamically explore the data.
- Step 5: Key measures like the total crude birth rate, birth rate by sex, and birth rate by ethnic group were calculated and displayed using cards and other visual elements.
- Step 6: The dashboard was designed with a consistent color scheme and layout to enhance readability and user experience.
- Step 7: The final dashboard was tested to ensure all filters and visualizations worked correctly and provided meaningful insights.

# Insights
        1. Trend Analysis by Ethnic Group:

The line chart shows a downward trend in the crude birth rate across all ethnic groups from 2001 to 2019, with Bumiputera consistently having the highest birth rate compared to other ethnicities. However, all groups show a declining pattern, which could indicate broader demographic changes.

        2. Birth Rate by Sex:

The pie chart reveals that the crude birth rates are almost evenly split between males and females, with slight variations. This insight is crucial for understanding gender dynamics in population growth.

        3. Crude Birth Rate by Ethnic Group:

The bar chart illustrates that Bumiputera has the highest crude birth rate, followed by Indians, Chinese, and others. This breakdown helps in identifying which ethnic groups contribute more to the overall birth rate.

By using the Year filter, users can explore how the crude birth rate changes annually. The dashboard allows stakeholders to pinpoint specific years where there were significant changes or trends that may warrant further investigation.

In addition, users also can use the filter to explore the segmentation by ethnic group and sex.

        5. Total sum of crude birth rate

A card visual was used to represent total of crude birth rate from 2001 to 2019.
 

# Further Actions
- Deeper Analysis Needed:
While the current dashboard provides a high-level view of the crude birth rate, further analysis could be done by integrating additional data, such as socio-economic factors, to understand the causes behind the trends.

- Policy Implications:
Policymakers can use this dashboard to target specific ethnic groups or years for intervention programs aimed at improving public health outcomes related to birth rates.

- Potential Expansion:
Future versions of this dashboard could include other demographic factors such as urban versus rural birth rates or the impact of healthcare initiatives on birth trends.
